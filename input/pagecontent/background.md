Regional, state and territorial public health population-based birth defect registries collect, manage, and analyze data about birth defect cases. Many birth defect surveillance programs have instituted mandatory reporting requirements in an effort to receive accurate and complete information about the suspected or diagnosed condition. However, in the absence of widely adopted interoperability standards in this domain, reporting complete and accurate information to public health registries has been time consuming, slow and subject to error and other difficulties. This leads to missed cases and undercounting of many conditions. Incomplete reporting of birth defect conditions can slow down progress in measuring the prevalence and impact of these conditions, complicate finding the underlying etiology and delay the development of primary and secondary prevention and intervention strategies.
